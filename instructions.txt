1. Creating unit tests for the most simple case. So you  experience how they are created and executed. We discussed some cases in quite detail. For you, the path us to do it. Without delay. This way you will shift from ' I never wrote any, don't know' to another state. ' I attempted'   ... result will be sucess or failure. Either is much better state. 

2. Design your tests
   . How will you test various functionality?
    . This helps you to understand the system much better as you know the expected behavior. Why is that important? Because that expected behavior is what shpuld satisfy the requirements (and, customer)

Check yourself
Implementation Correctness: Does your code follow the specifications?
Test Coverage: Do you test all the scenarios? Your test framework will give you a course response, based on percentage of the functions that have tests that have passed. That doesn't mean they are tested well. Your tests may be incomplete or too simple.
Test Quality: Are tests well-named, isolated, and clearly asserting specific behaviors?
Edge Case Handling: Do you identify and test tricky edge cases?
Submission
Submit:

meme_builder.py - Your completed implementation
test_meme_builder.py - Your comprehensive test suite
README.md - Brief notes on your testing strategy and any interesting edge cases you discovered

Recommendations
Write tests as you implement - Don't wait until the end
Test one thing at a time - Each test should verify one specific behavior
Use descriptive test names - test_vote_for_own_submission_rejected is better than test_vote_1
Think about boundaries - What happens at exactly 3 characters? Exactly 200?
Consider the user's perspective - What mistakes might a meme creator make?
Run your tests frequently - Make sure they pass (or fail when they should)
Have fun with test data - Use actual meme-style text (realistic data) in your test cases!
